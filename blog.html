        <td>Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive.</td>
        <td>Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.</td>

    <div class="">
      <p><span class="fw-bold text-info">Event loop-</span> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.</p>
    <p> <span class="text-info fw-bold">Event loop work-</span> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
